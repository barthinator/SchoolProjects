INTRODUCTION: THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING AND CHALLENGING AREAS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. IT HAS RAISED SOME OF THE MOST PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VERY NATURE OF HUMANKIND AND WHAT DISTINGUISHES HUMANS FROM OTHER CREATURES, BOTH ANIMATE AND INANIMATE. INTELLIGENCE IS THE ONE CHARACTERISTIC ALMOST UNIVERSALLY AGREED UPON AS SETTING HUMANS APART FROM OTHER CREATURES. ANY SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO CREATE NONHUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS BOUND TO STIMULATE STRONG REACTIONS. THE CENTRAL QUESTION AT THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE IS: CAN MACHINES THINK? THE DECLARED GOAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH IS TO TEACH MACHINES TO THINK, THAT IS, TO DISPLAY THOSE CHARACTERISTICS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION CAN MACHINES THINK? IS PIVOTAL TO THE DISCIPLINE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. IN ASKING THIS QUESTION, HOWEVER, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO FACE THE FACT THAT THE ANSWER MAY NOT BE A NEAT YES OR NO BUT RATHER A HIGHLY QUALIFIED TO CERTAIN EXTENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE IN THE LIGHT OF OUR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE THAT INTELLIGENCE IN BOTH HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS IS NOT A BINARY FUNCTION BUT RATHER A CONTINUUM. SOME PEOPLE ARE SMARTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE, AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF HOUSEHOLD PETS WHERE THE DOG IS FAR SMARTER THAN THE CAT IN SOME WAYS. IF MACHINES CAN THINK, IT SHOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE THAT SOME COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE SMARTER THAN OTHERS OR THAT SOME SYSTEMS MAY BE INTELLIGENT IN SOME AREAS WHILE MORONIC IN OTHERS. THE IMITATION GAME PROPOSED BY ALAN TURING PROVIDES A RELATIVELY OBJECTIVE, UNAMBIGUOUS RESTATEMENT OF THE QUESTION CAN MACHINES THINK? IN OPERATIONAL LANGUAGE. THIS CLASSIC DEFINITION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH WHICH THIS CHAPTER OPENS HAS STOOD UP WELL UNDER THE TEST OF TIME. NEXT SEVERAL CRITICISMS OF MACHINE LANGUAGE ARE PROPOSED AND ADDRESSED BY TURING HIMSELF. THESE CONTRARY OPINIONS STILL CHARACTERIZE MOST OF THE PRESENT DAY DOUBTS AS TO THE FEASIBILITY OF AI. SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF AI ARE OUTLINED NEXT, FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF ISSUES RAISED BY RESEARCH IN AI. THE CHAPTER CONCLUDES WITH A SUMMARY OF THE HISTORY OF AI RESEARCH AND REPRESENTATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE FOUNDERS OF THIS NEW SCIENCE. THE IMPORTANT TOPICS ARE: LANGUAGES OF AI, PROLOG, LISP, SEARCH TECHNIQUES, GAME PLAYING, AUTOMATED REASONING, PROBLEM SOLVING, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION, PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, EXPERT SYSTEMS, PATTERN RECOGNITION, COMPUTER VISION, ROBOTICS, MACHNE LEARNING, NEURAL NETWORKS, ETC. SOME OF THE WELL KNOWN RESEARCHERS IN AI ARE: ALAN TURING, JOHN MCCARTHY, MARVIN MINSKY, HANS BERLINER, LARRY WOS, HERBERT SIMON, TERRY WINOGRAD, ROGER SCHANK, DOUGLAS LENAT, ALLEN NEWELL, EDWARD FEIGENBAUM, DONALD WATERMAN, DONALD MICHIE, RANDALL DAVIS, BERTHOLD PAUL HORN, RAJ REDDY, RYSZARD MICHALSKI, JOHN HOPFIELD.
